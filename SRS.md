# System Features

## 3.1 User Profile
The Assist-Pack app will require users to create a user profile with mandatory fields such as Full Name, Short Name, Primary Number, Email Address, and WhatsApp Number. Optional information includes a Photo, GitHub Account, Postal Address, and Office Address. The user profile will help personalize the app experience and enable better customization of reminders and alerts.

## 3.2 Master Data
The app will include pre-populated master data for common tasks, which users can add, delete, or modify. Master data includes Assignment Type, Assignment Sub-Type, Critical Level, Status, and Tags. This feature allows users to quickly categorize tasks and streamline their workflow.

## 3.3 Assignments, ToDo Lists, and Notes
Users can create assignments, todo lists, and notes through various input methods, including writing, speaking, capturing images, and recording videos. Each item can have multiple tags attached, helping users search and filter their tasks more effectively. This feature is designed to offer flexibility and convenience for users with different preferences and needs.

## 3.4 Reminders
Assist-Pack will send configurable on-screen reminders based on the priority assigned by the user. Critical tasks or cases due soon will trigger an on-screen message with an associated checklist that must be checked before the task occurs. Reminders can also be text-to-speech or recorded clips, offering users multiple ways to receive alerts.

## 3.5 Summary of Tasks
Users can request a summary of pending and completed tasks for specific timeframes, such as today, tomorrow, this week, this month, or between custom date ranges. This feature provides a clear overview of the user's workload and helps them stay organized and on track.

## 3.6 Backup and Restore
The app will allow users to export their data, including profile, master data, assignments, todo lists, notes, pictures, audio, and videos, to a timestamped CSV file. Users can send the backup file to their email address, WhatsApp account, or GitHub repository. The backup feature supports four types of backups: 1) full backup, 2) delta backup, 3) full backup (without media), and 4) delta backup (without media). In case of data loss or device change, users can easily restore their data by importing the latest backup file.

# External Interface Requirements

## 4.1 User Interfaces
The Assist-Pack app will feature a user-friendly interface optimized for ease of use on mobile devices. Core functions such as managing assignments, todo lists, and notes will require minimal taps for viewing, creating, and modifying. Alternative input methods, such as voice recording, image capture, and video recording, will be easily accessible. The app's design will prioritize clarity and simplicity, ensuring that users can navigate and use the app efficiently.

## 4.2 Hardware Interfaces
As a mobile application developed using React Native, Assist-Pack will interface with the user's smartphone hardware, including touchscreens, microphones, cameras, and speakers. The app will also utilize the device's storage to save user data securely. Future releases may support additional hardware interfaces such as tablets, smartwatches, and vehicle tabs.

## 4.3 Software Interfaces
Assist-Pack will be developed using the React Native framework, enabling compatibility with both iOS and Android operating systems. The app will function independently, without relying on an internet connection, and will store user data locally on the device. In future releases, the app may interface with other software, such as Google Calendar or email and messaging platforms, to provide additional functionality and integrations.

## 4.4 Communication Interfaces
The current version of Assist-Pack will primarily operate without an internet connection, storing data locally and functioning as a standalone application. However, the app will use communication interfaces for data backup and restore features, allowing users to send CSV files to their email address, WhatsApp account, or GitHub repository. In future releases, the app may require additional communication interfaces to support third-party service integrations, syncing events and reminders, or providing language support and localization.
